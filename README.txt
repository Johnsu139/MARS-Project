EDA Explorer - Contains a code which detects motion artifacts
	however, it does not produce feasible results. The results
	code are shown in this folder

Machine Learning - Contains machine learning code and code which
	produces feature matrix from a set of EDA data. There are data
	provided in this folder.

Motion Artifact - Contains code for several motion artifact removal algorithms
	however, most of them are not finished.

Plots - Contains images of the signals that are being studied in this research.

Raw Data - GSR data that was originally provided by our supervisor Kunal. There is also
	another folder with datasets which was from the PhysioNet website. These
	were used during testing of some algorithms.

Related Research - These contain research papers for which some of the algorithms
	used in this research was based on.

Documentation_Timeline - A documentation of a timeline for a part of the year.
